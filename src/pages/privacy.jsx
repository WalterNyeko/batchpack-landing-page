                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is

              <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
              <p>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
                information about your device, including information about your
                web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that
                are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the
                Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
                products that you view, what websites or search terms referred
                you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the
                Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
                “Device Information.”
              </p>
              <p>
                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or
                  computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For
                  more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies,
                  visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">this page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect
                  data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service
                  provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used
                  to record information about how you browse the Site.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a

                you, including your name, billing address, shipping address,
                payment information (including credit card numbers), email
                address, and phone number. We refer to this information as
                “Order Information.”
              </p>

              <p>
                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy
                Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order
                Information.
