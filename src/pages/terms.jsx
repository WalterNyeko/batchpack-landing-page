                communication.
              </p>

              <p>Here are terms of our Standard License:</p>

              <div className="d-flex">
                <span className="badge badge-rounded-circle badge-success-soft mt-1 mr-4">

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  The Standard License grants you a non-exclusive right to make

                </span>

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  You are licensed to use the Item to create one End Product for
                  yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the
                  End Product can be distributed for Free.

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  If a Theme contains code, images, or content sourced from
                  elsewhere under a different license, that item retains its
                  original license. The license for the code, images, or content
                  will be noted by the Theme author. You are responsible for
                  adhering to the original license or clearing it with the
                  author of the code, image, or content.

                  This license can be terminated if you breach it and you lose

                  The author of the Theme retains ownership of the Theme, but
