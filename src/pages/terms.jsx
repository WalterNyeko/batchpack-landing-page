              <p className="text-gray-800">
                By visiting and/or taking any action on BatchPack, you
                confirm that you are in agreement with and bound by the terms
                outlined below. These terms apply to the website, emails, or any
                other communication.
              </p>

              <p>Here are terms of our Standard License:</p>

              <div className="d-flex">
                <span className="badge badge-rounded-circle badge-success-soft mt-1 mr-4">
                  <i className="fe fe-check" />

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  The Standard License grants you a non-exclusive right to make
                  use of Theme you have purchased.

                </span>

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  You are licensed to use the Item to create one End Product for
                  yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the
                  End Product can be distributed for Free.

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  If a Theme contains code, images, or content sourced from
                  elsewhere under a different license, that item retains its
                  original license. The license for the code, images, or content
                  will be noted by the Theme author. You are responsible for
                  adhering to the original license or clearing it with the
                  author of the code, image, or content.

                <p className="text-gray-800">
                  This license can be terminated if you breach it and you lose
                  the right to distribute the End Product until the Theme has
                  been fully removed from the End Product.

                  The author of the Theme retains ownership of the Theme, but
                  grants you the license on these terms. This license is between
                  the author of the Theme and you. Be Colossal LLC (Bootstrap
                  Themes) are not a party to this license or the one granting
                  you the license.
